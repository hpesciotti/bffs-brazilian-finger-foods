## **1. Introduction**

BFF would consist of a small business specializing in Brazilian appetizers in Dublin. The growing Brazilian community and the cosmopolitan nature of the Irish capital—where cuisines from all over the world are represented—make this business venture promising.

An acronym for Brazilian Finger Foods, BFFs is also a play on the phrase Best Friends Forever, bringing originality to the brand name. The dual meaning evokes an affectionate relationship with the comfort foods sold on the site. Acronyms are generally easier to remember, aiding in brand marketing.

Like many small businesses, given the current real estate crisis, BFF focuses on selling its products online, avoiding needing a fixed store or headquarters. This approach aims to boost sales and strengthen the brand through an attractive e-commerce platform. The sale of frozen products in the food industry offers a significant advantage: their relative longevity, with a shelf life of up to a year. This allows for better planning. The web application on the shop owner’s side includes tools for managing sales and offering discounts on products that have been in stock longer.

As an e-commerce platform, BFFs a is a fully functional e-commerce solution, combining frontend and backend tools to provide an intuitive, simple, and efficient shopping experience. It also automates billing, order processing, and stock management.

## **2. UX Design**

### **2.1. Strategy/Scope and Structural Plane**

Overall, the primary objective of this project was to develop an e-commerce store that met the assessment criteria of the Code Institute's Project 5: E-Commerce Module, using the Django framework. The platform was required to function as a responsive online store, integrating Stripe as the payment system, providing user and guest views for authentication (via Django Allauth), and incorporating store features alongside a demonstration of marketing and SEO skills.

I have some experience in the catering industry, where stock control was one of my responsibilities as a catering assistant. Drawing from this experience, I implemented a few ideas in the Shop Admin section within the limited time available to develop the platform. Additionally, during the creation of user stories, having completed the mock project Boutique Ado—which successfully covers most customer/user experiences—I found it interesting to add some additional nuance to the shop owner functionalities. Unfortunately, I was unable to implement all the planned features, opting to exclude some "could-have" stories (as per the MoSCoW prioritisation method) from the MVP.

From the client’s perspective, it was important to feature engaging text, appealing images, and a design that would entice users to “crave” the products. Through benchmarking several Brazilian brands, I identified the key elements they use to promote similar products and incorporated them into the website. Furthermore, a primary UX goal for the web application was to convey trustworthiness, ensuring that end users would feel confident and safe when making a purchase.

### **2.3. Skeleton & Surface Planes**

#### Wireframes

The wireframes were created using Balsamiq. At this stage, along with the user stories, it was possible to identify the functionalities, pages, and data to be presented in later phases. 

Although the design is simple, comparing the final result with the wireframes shows that the production phase successfully implemented what was proposed at the outset.

#### Datbase Schema

The cave registration system was structured using a relational database schema which the models are: User, Profile, Cave, and Report. The models are connected by relationships defined through foreign key associations. User is structured by Django AllAuth, a set of applications that automate tasks related to addressing authentication, registration, and account management.

The Cave, which stores the main data collected by the website, is linked to the User model via a foreign key, establishing that each cave entry is created and managed by a specific user, ensuring ownership of cave records. The Cave model includes fields like cave_name, latitude, longitude, elevation, length, depth, area, and volume, each with specific validation constraints to ensure consistency in data entry.

The Profile model, in turn, is associated with the User model through a one-to-one relationship established by the user. This allows each user to have a detailed profile while maintaining the core authentication provided by Django All Auth. Additionally, the Profile model handles user information, allowing them to edit their profile and access the website's main functions, like adding a cave, provided the user provides an email_for_contact, bio, and display name, which are not mandatory fields. This relationship ensures the integrity of user data, connecting it back to cave entries and reports through consistent foreign key relationships across the models.

Finally, The Report model captures the relationship between users and cave entries in terms of data inconsistencies. A report gathers info about the reporting user, the cave being reported, the cave owner, and the inconsistency. This is managed through foreign keys that ensure each report correctly maps out the cave and the users involved.

### **2.4. Design** 

For the page design, I drew inspiration from the interface I used most often while preparing environmental impact reports, which in this case was Microsoft Word. The blank page in the centre with grey borders would bring comfort to the centred content and familiarity to users, most of whom share a similar professional background to mine.

As for the logo, it went through several versions and colours. After testing a few possibilities, one of which was my user profile photo, I decided on something more elemental and simple. The capital greek letter omega is commonly used as a cartographic symbol to designate a cave, and this was present in several versions of the logo. Regarding the colour, I chose orange, as it resembles the soil developed from the rocks of the Quadrilátero Ferrífero.

#### Colour Scheme

I chose a palette that would ornate with orange, white, and grey for the colour scheme that inspired the site's design. Since much of the content will be presented through text and tables, to maintain a clean appearance, I decided to choose a dark tone for the text. To that end, I checked the accessibility of a dark blue shade and a white tone. I opted out of shades of grey or black for this purpose, as I found the dark blue tone more elegant.

#### Font

I chose Josefin Sans for the items in the nav-bar and Inter Sans for the rest of the text.

### **2.5. Agile and Project Managing** 

I tried to implement Agile Methodology during the planning of my full stack framework project. The planning was conducted with [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/hpesciotti/projects/3). I chose to limit my entries to Tasks, User Stories, linking them through GitHub interface. 

I had initially around 30 days to execute the project, as suggest by the CI Scheduler. I would like to point out that was a very short time frame to develop a full-stack application and taking into account my learning curve with Django and Boostrap, I think the endproduct can achive the MVP status. 

Here is a draft of my initial planning divided um four sprints, tackling the various content involved on Speleometrics.

| Sprint | Start       | Finish      | Content                                    |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|

### **3. Features**

#### **3.1. User view**

To ensure an engaging interface and data protection, it was necessary to establish some permissions for the website users.
Moreover, the classification of users reflects upon the user's access to some pages. 
The following charts show the accessibility of the features per user type.

| Feature / User Type       | Unlogged User | Logged User | Superuser |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Home**                  | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| **About**                 | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| **Caves**                 |               |             |           |
| - Map Search              | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Table Search            | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Cave Page               | Visible       | Visible     | Visible   |
| - Report Cave             | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |
| **User Area**             |               |             |           |
| - Register a Cave         | Not Visible    | Visible     | Visible   |

| - Report Page             | Not Visible    | Not Visible  | Visible   |

[Back to top](#readme---table-of-contents)

#### **3.2. CRUD Functionality**

The Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionalities are planned for Speleometrics. Through the Database Model, it is clear that full CRUD functionality is available for the Cave database, meaning that any user who has registered a cave and a superuser has access to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Regarding user profiles, the only operation currently unavailable is the ability to delete them. Since cave records are crucial to the web application's purpose, deleting profiles could result in data loss (cascade effect). Therefore, the option to delete a profile was not initially planned. Additionally, as transparency is a guiding principle of the project, most functionalities are available in Read mode, even for users who are not logged in. The following chart displays the CRUD functions per page per user.

| Feature / User Type       | Unlogged User | Logged User           | Superuser         |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| **Home**                  | R             | R                     | R                  |
| **About**                 | R             | R                     | R                  |
| **Cave**                  |               |                       |                    |

| **User Area**             |               |                       |                    |
| - Register a Cave         | R             | C                     | C                  |
| - My Caves                | R             | U, D                  | R, U, D            |

### **3.3. Features Showcase**

#### Header

The header features two versions tailored for both mobile and desktop views. Both versions include the site's logo, which has hover and focus functions aligned with the adopted colour scheme. The logo follows current trends by maintaining a minimalist design.

In the desktop version, links are presented as nav-pills, responsive to hover, focus, and active states. The purpose of the nav-pills is to effectively indicate the section or area of the site being accessed. It is important to note that the "add cave" section, which depends on user validation and is accessed through the user area, sits between the cave and user area tabs.

The navbar is also responsive to user type. When the user is not logged in, the user area is visible but appears as disabled, prompting the user to log in or sign up. Additionally, only superusers can access the reports tab, which remains invisible to other users.

The mobile version includes the logo and stack bars for the drop-down menu. This version lists the sublinks under the Caves section directly without requiring additional clicks. Similar to the desktop version, the responsiveness to the user's status is also applied.

#### Footer

I decided not to insert relevant website information in the footer.
Instead, I inserted Font Awesome links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
The footer is very minimalistic, almost imperceptible, as intended.

![Footer](documentation/showcase/footer.png)

[Back to top](#readme---table-of-contents)

#### Home / Index page

The home/index page is comprised of three distinct elements: the hero image, the call-to-action banner linked to a sign-in button (which switches to user area if the user is logged in), and the Cave Metrics section.

The hero image is represented by a panoramic photograph of the Serra do Curral, one of the geomorphological units included in the registry. This range features the Quadrilátero Ferrífero's quartzite and ironstone-supported ridges, with most of the region's caves attributed to the latter. The hero image serves to create visual appeal. In the mobile version, this image is responsive and centers on one of the mountain peaks.

The call-to-action banner aims to inform users about the purpose of the site and intuitively encourage them to register via the button. The text succinctly explains the website's main goals.

![Hero Image and Banner](documentation/showcase/hero_image.png)

![Hero Image and Banner](documentation/showcase/hero_image_mobile.png)

Finally, the Cave Metrics section provides statistical data on caves records, both for the entire Quadrilátero Ferrífero region and the geomorphological units it comprises. This section serves as a valuable reference point for a preliminary assessment of significance. Magnitude ratios are essential for project planning that may affect the speleological heritage. Additionally, these metrics can be integrated into environmental studies without the time-consuming process of consolidating and calculating data, as they are easily accessible through the web application. In the backend, those statistics are run every time there's a request to update the page. I opted not to create a database for this function because this information is dynamic, and there was no need for early optimization as the page's loading time was fast.

![Cave Metrics](documentation/showcase/qf_statistics.png)

The section also includes the total number of caves and those recorded in each geomorphological unit. To ensure greater readability and minimize confusion among the tables, the units are embedded within an accordion. In the mobile version, tables have the overflow-x: scroll attribute for screens smaller than 300px, facilitating the reading of presented values.

#### Cave Map Search

The page offers a GIS interface through the Leaflet tool, where users can view the location of caves marked with a custom icon. Clicking on the icon triggers a pop-up displaying general information about the cave, with the cave and user names hyperlinked to their respective individual pages. The page also features a composite altimetry basemap with varying scales, using data from SRTM and even IBGE.

Cave locations are displayed by a function that iterates through all records and returns the geographical coordinates of each cave for the map. In the credits section, links are provided to resources that guided the integration of Django elements into JavaScript functions.

Additional filters can be implemented on this page to optimize the loading speed, but to reach the MVP, such functionalities have been postponed as future features. Nevertheless, the main acceptance criteria for this feature were achieved. To fulfil the requirements of User Story [#6](https://github.com/hpesciotti/Speleometrics/issues/6), a new tool needed to be used, probably ArcGIS web, which would take a long time to implement. I guess the original scope was too convoluted.

#### Table Search

The Cave Search allows users to search by exact term, name, or author, or to list caves in ascending and descending order based on metric parameters. This functionality was challenging to implement, and I based it on the work of Joy Zadan (PP5). 

This page offers two distinct versions for cave listing. The search results are displayed in a table on larger screens, while on smaller resolutions, the caves are presented as cards. This approach ensures that search results are easily interpretable on mobile devices. 

As shown on the map page, users can access the specific cave and user pages via hyperlinks. Clicking the links opens the desired page in a new browser tab, allowing users to continue their search seamlessly. Lastly, this page offers options to edit and delete data if accessed by a superuser.

#### About

The About page is the most straightforward page on the site, consisting solely of text and static images. 
Its purpose is to provide general information about the studied area, caves, and environmental licensing, especially regarding the relevance and speleological metrics. At the bottom of the page are external links with the `noopener` attribute to official sources on the topic.

#### Profile

The Profile page includes several checks to ensure the user has filled in their contact email. The contact email is essential for user interaction when requesting information, as described in user stories #10 and #11. On first access, the user is redirected to the profile edit page. After filling it in, users can access the pages to add caves, check their registered caves, or edit their user profile.

#### My Caves

Through the profile, users can access "My Caves," which returns their registered caves. The interface is similar to the table search, offering users the option to open individual cave pages, edit the caves, and delete the records. In mobile mode, the table view switches to cards for better presentation.

#### Add Cave / Cave Edit

The "Add Cave" feature is authorized for users whose profiles have a contact email. The function that renders this page checks if the user is logged in (`@login_required`) and if they are the owner of the cave (`profile_user = get_object_or_404(User, username=username)` and `profile = get_object_or_404(Profile, user=profile_user)`). 

The form responsible for adding a cave includes required fields such as `cave_name`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `length`, `depth`, `area`, and `volume`, all of which undergo validation, including Regex checks, to ensure consistent data. If the user fills out a field incorrectly, the form returns a custom alert message indicating where the error occurred. It's worth mentioning that despite the option to upload a cave map, no maps have been added to the current cave records (although one appears in the screenshots). This is because materials such as cave sketches and photos are often provided to mining companies under non-disclosure agreements, which unfortunately prevents me from attaching such data at this time. Lastly, the same form used in `cave_add` is also utilized for editing cave data (`cave_edit`), but the function that renders it retrieves the cave data and populates each field accordingly.

Through the profile, users can access "My Caves," which returns their registered caves. The interface is similar to the table search, offering users the option to open individual cave pages, edit the caves, and delete the records. In mobile mode, the table view switches to cards for better presentation.

#### Cave Page

The cave page consists of a simple layout where the data is presented individually in a textual format. On this page, the owner of the cave has the option to delete it. Conversely, any user can submit a report for inconsistencies. This report is submitted through a modal equipped with a text box where the reporting user only needs to fill in the specific inconsistency found in the data. The other data points, such as `cave`, `reported_by`, `cave_owner`, and `reported_created_date`, are automatically collected.

#### Report

The report page is restricted to superusers. Its purpose is to list records with inconsistent data. This page includes filtering options to allow site administrators to organize review requests and provide the necessary follow-up. Each item can be viewed separately using the "Detail" button. 

At the end of the review process, the admin can delete the review request. At this stage of the website, there is no automated way for the user to track if their report request has been addressed, except through email communication from the administrator.

- Register caves in **INSTALLED_APPS** in **settings.py** as 'caves',
- Run ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser``` and enter credentials to create a superuser, allowing Admin access.
- Run migrations with commands: ```python3 manage.py makemigrations``` and ```python3 manage.py migrate```
- Create an **env.py** to store all confidential data such as the **DATABASE_URL** and **SECRET_KEY**. 

```import os
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<CI's data base>"
os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL")
```

- Add envy.py to must be added to your **gitignore**, so it will not be upload to GitHub.
- Reference the file in your project's **settings.py**: 
For adding to **settings.py**:

```
import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.exists("env.py"):
