### **5.1. Validation**

#### **Html Validation**

html validation was conducted through [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org). 
The following images are validation screenshots taken from the service with the website Heroku live link. 
 - The validator could not test the pages that required logged in user (profile User Section) superuser credentials (Reports Section) and error pages (500, 403 and 404).
 - All the pages were valid, with no errors or warnings except one:
    - Cave Page: The validator point out that there was a stray div tag on the page (this will be further discussed on Bugs).

#### **Performance Lighthouse**

In general, Lighthouse evaluated a good performance on all the website pages. The following image shows the score in the performance register by Google's Chrome validator. The cave map page, which relies on Leaflet API, comprised of a basemap and approximately 600 caves, got a score of 79 and 77, desktop and mobile, respectively. It is important to point out that similar webGIS pages have subpar lighthouse scores; as an example, I tested the IDE Sisema page with no vectorial features selected, just the basemap. The result for the desktop was 59. Thus, the scores obtained are reasonable, considering the page's content.

#### **Python PEP 8 Validation**
[Code Institute Python PEP 8 Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) was used, no major error was detected, aside from indentation and whitespaces. After some refactoring the Python Linter didn't encoutered any errors.

### **5.3. Bugs & Fixes** 

##### **Bug 01**

Description: The edit_profile function returned a NameError "name for form is not defined". This must have happened due to a reference to an undefined variable pointed out to the form in the context. Through some code investigation, I detected that the function was not correctly accessing the instance of the Profile model associated with the logged-in user.

<details>
<summary>Bug 01</summary>

![Bug 01](documentation/testing/bugs/bug_1.png)

</details>

Solution: The solution involved verifying if the function utilized the appropriate instance of the user's profile. This was achieved by modifying the edit_profile function to correctly reference the logged-in user's profile through the correct query set, allowing for the data to be retrieved.

##### **Bug 02**

Description: The browser encountered a NoReverseMatch error when attempting to use the reverse function for the profile URL in Django. This error must have happened because the URL pattern did not match the parameters being passed to the reverse function. 

<details>
<summary>Bug 02</summary>

![Bug 02](documentation/testing/bugs/bug_2.png)

</details>

Resolution: I investigated some former students' git hub repos, and I came to the conclusion that this error was somehow connected to the problem of the user being created by Django All Auth and not being connected later to the Profile database. So, based on Amy Richards's repo, I implemented signals in profile models to ensure that the created users and the future users would have the profile created simultaneously as the user was created. Here is the snippet that I used:

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    """
    Creates a profile for a new user.
    """
    if created:

##### **Bug 03**

Description: A layout related bug. For unknown reasons, at that time, I could not apply paddings to profile form labels.

Description: A layout related bug. For unknown reasons, at that time, I could not apply paddings to profile form labels.
Solution: I found a thread in stack overflow indicating a solution to the matter. This bug happens because a label is an inline element, and so is not affected by the top and bottom padding. The solution was to transform the labels into block-level elements, thus allowing the padding to have an effect.


##### **Bug 04**

Description: During the customization of the signup form, due to the necessity of making it necessary for the user to provide a valid e-mail address for contact in the profile page, the custom html would return a None placeholder text in the user name's input area.

</details>

Solution: I thought it was a placeholder mistake, but the placeholder name was an indication username. During a call with my mentor, he pointed out that none was returned from value={{ form.username.value }}. This template variable was not important to the signup page, so I ended up removing it.

##### **Bug 05**

Description:  I added a modal to confirm deletion actions, but in the mobile versions of website the modal would not appear with the fading effect occupying the entire screen and/or the buttons would not work.

</details>

Solution: Through some code investigation, I concluded that the bug happened in mobile versions because it was connected to the card representation on small screens, which would override the tables on bigger screens. This function consists of a for loop that returns template variables to populate the cave information shown on the screen. The lock of the screen or the freezing fading effect and absence of the modal box happens because the modal if statement was inserted inside the indentation for the loop card. I adjusted the indentation, and the page and modals worked as expected.

##### **Bug 06**

Description: When editing a registered cave it would ask for the user to provide a user, which is an occult field, because this field should not be altered or even filled during cave add; the filling of the field is automatic. I tried to set the user field to not required, and the cave record would return without a user/author. This was unexpected because the edit_caver function would save the user during the editing process (cave.user = user.username), but this did not prevent the empty user outcome. The following screenshot was taken during the debugging section, and the user field was made visible.

</details>

Solution: I refactored the edit_cave function to maintain the user as not required, capture the cave user from the cave model, and pass it through a variable user, which was attributed to the cave.user after the validation of the form. This adjustment corrected the issue.

##### **Bug 07**

Description: The notification modal was displaying empty when refresh or redirect requests were made.

Solution: I detected this bug during testing, and corrected it by inserting a none to the style attribute of the modal. I implemented this by an If statement, if there was no messages mode display is none.



### **5.4. Unsolved Bugs** 

Through my testing, I have not detected critical bugs, but there are three minor issues left unsolved.
They are not bugs per se because they would not hinder the usage of the website.
Two of them are more layout inconsistencies, and the last one is an error message trailing div from the w3c validator.

Unresolved Bug 01 - layout inconsistency on the button to upload button of the cav_map. My system is in pot-br, so the default is displayed in Portuguese, but this will change according to the system's main language. The problem is that the box doesn't follow the theme design of the website. To fix this inconsistency, I would have to customise all the add_cave forms, but all my validation done in the model would have to be inserted again, demanding more time, which I was short. So, I opted not to solve this issue.

<details>
<summary>Bug 01</summary>

</details>

The second layout inconsistency has to do with the whitespaces displayed in front of the bio text during the editing of a profile.
I looked at it, but I could not find a quick fix. To reach MVP and implement other features, I judged this would not be fixed at this time.

<summary>Bug 02</summary>

The validator w3c html validator pointed out that there was a stray div tag on the page.
I double-checked my code, and there was no indentation problem; there was no layout change as I intended and no loss to the navigability. I suppose this issue concerns the Django's rendering of the page.
