It's a widely celebrated dish and is considered a national treasure in Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Iraq. Its popularity extends across North Africa, Turkey, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of the Caucasus, including Armenia. Syrian-Lebanese immigrants from the former Ottoman Empire introduced this iconic recipe to Brazil. By 1920, the Brazilian census recorded over fifty thousand Syrian and Lebanese residents, marking the beginning of a culinary fusion.</p><p>Originally, the dish consisted of flatbread topped with a flavorful mixture of minced lamb, parsley, onion, tomato, pine nuts, and aromatic spices. However, in Brazil, the recipe evolved to embrace local ingredients. With lamb being scarce and beef abundant, the Brazilian version often features a deliciously seasoned beef filling.
